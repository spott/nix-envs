These are nix flake environments that can be used as a jumping off point for creating a new environment.

Use these by running:
```
nix flake init -t "github:spott/nix-envs#<environment_name>"
```

Or clone this repo and use:
```
nix flake init -t "<path to repo>#<environment_name>"
```

The environment names are in the top level `flake.nix`
